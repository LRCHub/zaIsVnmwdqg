[00:09.04] We don't wanna believe it, that it's all gone
[00:13.08] Just a matter of minutes, before the sun goes down
[00:17.15] We're afraid to admit it, but I know you know, know that
[00:25.49] We should've known better, we kept on trying
[00:29.42] And it's time that we see it, the fire's dying out
[00:33.48] Can't believe that I say this, we're out of chances now
[00:38.03] And I just want you to know that
[00:54.03] 
[00:41.08] You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
[00:45.15] And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
[00:49.23] Step by step, I'll move on, and get on with life
[00:53.27] So I let go, and I hope, you'll be happy now
[01:15.27] 
[00:57.37] You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
[01:01.45] And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
[01:05.47] Step by step, I'll move on, and get on with life
[01:09.56] So I let go, and I hope, you'll be happy now
[01:31.56] 
[01:15.15] I hope you'll be happy now
[01:18.97] Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
[01:23.32] I hope you'll be happy now
[01:26.69] Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
[01:42.69] 
[01:42.93] Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
[01:58.93] 
[01:59.95] I hope you'll be happy now
[02:12.95] 
[02:05.14] Thought we would make it, if I just held on
[02:09.28] But it's really crazy, how love could fade so fast
[02:13.33] We said "forever", but now we're in the past
[02:17.72] And I just want you to know that
[02:33.72] 
[02:20.75] You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
[02:24.80] And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
[02:28.88] Step by step, I'll move on, and get on with life
[02:32.97] So I let go, and I hope, you'll be happy now
[02:54.97] 
[02:37.02] You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
[02:41.03] And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
[02:45.02] Step by step, I'll move on, and get on with life
[02:49.11] So I let go, and I hope, you'll be happy now
[03:11.11] 
[03:10.79] Yeah, I hope you'll be happier
[03:15.11] I hope you'll be happier
[03:19.23] I hope you'll be happy now
[03:23.27] I hope you'll be happy now
